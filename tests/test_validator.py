Test Suite for Validator's Dual Evaluation Mechanism

Core Components to Mock:
1. R2DatasetLoader - for both own and random data loading
2. Model (LlamaForCausalLM) - for loss computation
3. Comms - for gradient gathering
4. Transformer/Compressor - for gradient processing
5. Wandb - for metric logging

4. Implement tests for moving average initialization
5. Add tests for score normalization edge cases
6. Implement tests for multi-miner scenarios
